window.Telegram.WebApp user info to serverless function and back to App.js

I just wanted to test Netlify serverless functions' interaction with my App.js file in a React app. 
I am new to React and Netlify, and just wanted to see if data I pass from the App.js TO a serverless function is returned back the the App.js so that I could log it to the console, or output it to the DOM or whatever.
